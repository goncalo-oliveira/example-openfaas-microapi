# Micro APIs with OpenFaaS and .NET

This code relates to an [article published on Medium](https://medium.com).

It's an example of a micro API built with .NET, [OpenFaaS](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) and [ASPNET Functions](https://github.com/goncalo-oliveira/faas-aspnet-template).

> The idea behind a micro API is to have a microservice that implements an API for a particular context - usually one or a very limited set of resources. That particular context ensures you don't duplicate too much code and that you focus the behaviour of the microservice.
